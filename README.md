# Can You Name All The States?
The player is presented with a blank map of the United States and must correctly name all 50 states. The game ends when the player has correctly named all 50 states or has given up by typing "exit". The player's score is the number of states they have correctly named.

## Prerequisites
You will need to have **Python 3** installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ananan37326/Can-You-Guess-All-the-States-of-America.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
```bash
cd Can-You-Guess-All-the-States-of-America
```

## Usage
1. Run the `main.py` script.
```python
python main.py
```
2. Type the name of a state when prompted. You need to type the full name of the state, not the abbreviation. Also, the name of the state must be spelled correctly.
3. Upon entering a correct state name, the state will be written on the map and the player will be prompted to enter another state name.
4. The game ends when the player has correctly named all 50 states or has given up by typing "exit". The player's score is the number of states they have correctly named.
5. The states that the player has not yet named will be written to a CSV file called `states_to_learn.csv`.
